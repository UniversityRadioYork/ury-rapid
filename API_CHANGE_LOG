NOTE: When changing the API version, change Rapid::Common::Constants.

0.5.0
  - Playlists and players are now grouped per-channel instead of into sets;
    URLs of the form '/service/players/X/' and '/service/playlists/X/' are now
    '/service/channels/X/player/' and '/service/channels/X/playlist/'
    respectively.  This is to accommodate BAPS-style playout systems in a more
    natural and easy-to-work-with manner.  For playout systems with a difference
    in player-playlist counts, consider having separate player-only and
    playlist-only channels.

0.4.1
  - New type for playlist POSTing, move, which takes a playlist reference
    and moves the referenced item to the POST location.

0.4.0
  - Stream and WebSocket payloads are now of the form
    {"type": "update", "<url>": <payload>}.
  - In WebSockets, to authenticate without HTTP Basic, send
    {"type": "auth", "username": "<username>", "password": "<password>"}.
  - WebSockets now sends errors of the form
    {"type": "error", "message": "<message>"}.

0.3.0
  - Items now have another field, 'duration', which tracks the item duration
    as long as the driver exposes it.
  - Players no longer have a 'duration' variable, as it has been moved to Item.

0.2.0
  - Items now have another field, "origin", which tracks the origin of the
    Item in URL format, driver support permitting.  For example, in BAPS, an
    item loaded into a Player from index 5 of player 2 will have origin
    "playlist://2/5".  This field will be NULL if not supplied.

0.1.0
  - Player item POSTing:
    - "playlist://<PLAYLIST-ID>/<INDEX>" is now a valid payload.
      - "playlist://<INDEX>" is now an alias for
        "playlist://<PLAYER-ID>/<INDEX>", in other words, local playlist
        loading.
    - {"type": "playlist", "playlist": <PLAYLIST-ID>, "index": <INDEX>} is now
      a valid payload.
      - {"type": "playlist", "index": <INDEX>} is now an alias for
        {"type": "playlist", "playlist": <PLAYER-ID>, "index": <INDEX>}, in
        other words, local playlist loading.

0.0.0
  - Initial versioned release
