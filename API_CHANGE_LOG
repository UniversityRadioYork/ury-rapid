NOTE: When changing the API version, change Bra::Common::Constants.

0.2.0
  - Items now have another field, "origin", which tracks the origin of the
    Item in URL format, driver support permitting.  For example, in BAPS, an
    item loaded into a Player from index 5 of player 2 will have origin
    "playlist://2/5".  This field will be NULL if not supplied.

0.1.0
  - Player item POSTing:
    - "playlist://<PLAYLIST-ID>/<INDEX>" is now a valid payload.
      - "playlist://<INDEX>" is now an alias for
        "playlist://<PLAYER-ID>/<INDEX>", in other words, local playlist
        loading.
    - {"type": "playlist", "playlist": <PLAYLIST-ID>, "index": <INDEX>} is now
      a valid payload.
      - {"type": "playlist", "index": <INDEX>} is now an alias for
        {"type": "playlist", "playlist": <PLAYER-ID>, "index": <INDEX>}, in
        other words, local playlist loading.
