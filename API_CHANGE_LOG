NOTE: When changing the API version, change Bra::Common::Constants.

0.4.1
  - New type for playlist POSTing, move, which takes a playlist reference
    and moves the referenced item to the POST location.

0.4.0
  - Stream and WebSocket payloads are now of the form
    {"type": "update", "<url>": <payload>}.
  - In WebSockets, to authenticate without HTTP Basic, send
    {"type": "auth", "username": "<username>", "password": "<password>"}.
  - WebSockets now sends errors of the form
    {"type": "error", "message": "<message>"}.

0.3.0
  - Items now have another field, 'duration', which tracks the item duration
    as long as the driver exposes it.
  - Players no longer have a 'duration' variable, as it has been moved to Item.

0.2.0
  - Items now have another field, "origin", which tracks the origin of the
    Item in URL format, driver support permitting.  For example, in BAPS, an
    item loaded into a Player from index 5 of player 2 will have origin
    "playlist://2/5".  This field will be NULL if not supplied.

0.1.0
  - Player item POSTing:
    - "playlist://<PLAYLIST-ID>/<INDEX>" is now a valid payload.
      - "playlist://<INDEX>" is now an alias for
        "playlist://<PLAYER-ID>/<INDEX>", in other words, local playlist
        loading.
    - {"type": "playlist", "playlist": <PLAYLIST-ID>, "index": <INDEX>} is now
      a valid payload.
      - {"type": "playlist", "index": <INDEX>} is now an alias for
        {"type": "playlist", "playlist": <PLAYER-ID>, "index": <INDEX>}, in
        other words, local playlist loading.
