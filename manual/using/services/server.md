# The Server Service

Rapid's *Server* service (`Rapid::Server::Service`) is a Thin-based HTTP
server that provides [HTML] and [JSON] views of the Rapid model.

## Configuring the Server Service

As with all services, Server is configured in [config.rb].  A sample
configuration for Server is provided as part of the `config.rb.example`
distributed with Rapid.

## Using the Server Service

The [Controlling Rapid] chapter of this manual provides information on how to
use Server to control Rapid.
