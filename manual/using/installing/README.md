# Installing Rapid

Rapid is distributed as a Ruby gem, and follows most of the same conventions
for fetching and installing as any other gem.

There are a few important things to remember when installing Rapid:

* Rapid requires a configuration file, [config.rb], to be present in order to
  run;
* If the [inspector] is being used, you will need to perform additional set-up
  on your HTTP server.

Details are provided in the manual chapters linked above.

[config.rb]: ../config/README.md
[inspector]: ../../controlling/inspector/README.md
