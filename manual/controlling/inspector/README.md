# The Rapid Inspector

When accessed by a Web browser (or any other user-agent that identifies itself
as accepting HTML), the Server service provides a rich HTML-based view of the
Rapid model.  We call this the _inspector_.

From the Inspector, one can:

* View the current state of the Rapid model;
* Issue simple requests to Rapid services through the model;
* Peek at the update channel.
