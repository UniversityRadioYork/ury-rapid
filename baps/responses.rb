    # Structures for BAPS responses
    #
    # In order to be able to parse responses from the BAPS client into a format
    # that can be read by the controller, we need to know their structure
    # (which parameters they take, and in which order).
    #
    # The Responses module defines each response known to the BAPS driver (out
    # of necessity; if the driver receives a response it doesn't know, the
    # driver cannot parse the rest of the stream and dies), as well as its
    # parameters in order of receipt and their corresponding names in the
    # response hashes produced by the ResponseParser.
