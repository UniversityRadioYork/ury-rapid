      # Structures for BAPS responses

      # In order to be able to parse responses from the BAPS client into a
      # format that can be read by the controller, we need to know their
      # structure (which parameters they take, and in which order).
      #
      # The Responses module defines each response known to the BAPS driver
      # (out of necessity; if the driver receives a response it doesn't know,
      # the driver cannot parse the rest of the stream and dies), as well as
      # its parameters in order of receipt and their corresponding names in the
      # response hashes produced by the response parser.
