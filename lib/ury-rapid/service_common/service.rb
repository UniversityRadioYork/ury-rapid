    # classes, but is recommended.

    # Subclasses must implement the #sub_model_structure method, which takes an
    # update channel and returns the service's sub-model.  The subclass may
    # perform any actions it needs to do on the structure in this method, such
    # as adding model handlers.
    #
    # Subclasses may use the readers #logger and #service_view to get access
    # to their logger and view of the model, respectively.
