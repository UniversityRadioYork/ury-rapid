        #   and index it is being POSTed to.
        #
        #   Services MAY choose not to implement non-local playlist copies, but
        #   SHOULD implement some form of copy.
        #
        #   Services may implement this by overriding #copy_from_local_playlist
        #   and #copy_from_foreign_playlist.

        #   SHOULD implement some form of move.
