  module ServiceCommon
    # A base class for Rapid services that connect to a network server
    #
    # This class provides an opinionated framework for TCP-based services,
    # that separates the service-specific workload into three separate objects:
    #
    # * A requester, which hooks into the service model and translates model
    #   changes into raw request strings to send to the downstream server;
    # * A responder, which receives parsed responses from the downstream
    #   server and updates the model to reflect them;
    # * A client, which is given a requests queue and access to the responder,
    #   and maintains the connection as well as the machinery needed to read
    #   and parse responses.
    #
    # See the Service class for information about methods that must be
    # implemented by subclasses of NetworkService. In addition, subclasses must
    # implement:
    #
    # * #make_requester, which returns a requester given the requests queue;
    # * #make_responder, which returns a responder given the requester;
    # * #make_client, which returns a client given the requests queue, host and
    #   port;
    # * #default_host, which returns a tuple of default host and port.
    #
    #
    # They may also override:
    #
    # * #initial_requests, which is given the requester and can be used to make
    #   any initial requests necessary to start the session with the network
    #   server upon the service start.
