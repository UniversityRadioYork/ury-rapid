  module Model
    # A view into the Rapid model
    #
    # A View tracks two different model roots: the 'global root', which is the
    # top of the entire model, and the 'local root', which is the top of the
    # part of the model the View's user is authorised to update directly.  For
    # example, a Service generally has a View whose local root is that
    # Service's sub-model.
    #
    # The global/local distinction is primarily one of security: only the owner
    # of a section of model can actually get at it directly, and only
    # authorised services/clients can interact with other parts of the model
    # (and, thus, other services).
    #
    # From the global root, a View can perform indirect queries (#get, #post,
    # #put, and #delete).  These are named by analogy to HTTP and REST APIs,
    # primarily for historical reasons; they require the View's caller to have
    # sufficient privileges (via a PrivilegeSet); and they do not directly
    # update the model but instead request that whatever handler code is
    # attached to the affected parts of the model is activated.
    #
    # From the local root, a View can grab model objects directly by URL
    # (#find), as well as perform direct updates on the model structure
    # (#insert, #replace, and #kill).  These do not require privileges, and
    # directly manipulate the model without any handlers being called.

      #
      # This is usually used in the situation where a service A has a view VA,
      # and is creating a child service B.  VB should contain a reference to
      # the same global root, as it is on the same model as A and VA, but B
      # should not be able to update all of A's model space, so its view VB is
      # VA but with the local root set to B's sub-model.
