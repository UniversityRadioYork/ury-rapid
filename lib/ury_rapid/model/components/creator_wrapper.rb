      # An object that wraps a Creator with a hook proc
      #
      # A CreatorWrapper allows a hook proc to be run after every use
      # of a Creator.  Usually, this hook is some sort of registrar
      # function that adds things like update channels and handlers to created
      # components.

      # This class has a very buzzwordy name, but is mostly harmless.

        #   by this CreatorWrapper are forwarded verbatim to the creator, with the
        #   hook invoked on the return value.
        # @param hook [Object]

        #   containing the constructor method symbol constructed component by
        #   performing some action and returning back a component.  The
