        # In the current version of the bra API, the standard methods for
        # POSTING an item into a player are:

        # playlist
        #   URL: 'playlist://[src-playlist/]src-index
        #   Hash: {type: :playlist, [playlist: src-playlist,] index: src-index}
        #
        #   Loads an item that is already at the given playlist reference.
        #
        #   If no source playlist is given, the playlist with the same ID as
        #   this player is substituted.  This can be useful in playout systems
        #   with linked players and playlists.
        #
        #   Drivers MAY choose not to implement this command.
        #
        #   Drivers may implement this by overriding #item_from_local_playlist
        #   and #item_from_foreign_playlist.
        # Supported URL protocols in this version of the bra API.
