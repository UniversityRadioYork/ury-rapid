      # Playlist references refer to items in playlists inside the model's
      # playlist set, by their position indices and playlist IDs respectively.
      #
      # A playlist reference is either a local or foreign playlist reference:
      #
      # - Local references are the pseudo-URL body '<playlist-index>' or the
      #   hash { index: <playlist-index> }, and reference an index in the
      #   playlist whose ID is returned by #local_playlist_id;
      # - Foreign references are the pseudo-URL body
      #   '<playlist-id>/<playlist-index>' or the hash
      #   { playlist: <playlist-id>, index: <playlist-index>, and reference
      #   an index in the playlist with the specified ID.
      #
      # Implementors must implement the method #local_playlist_id to return
      # the ID of the 'current' playlist from the implementor's perspective,
      # or raise an error if there is no such playlist.
