      # An object representing a BAPS command word
      #
      # BAPS command words may be split into two separate codes:
      #
      # * A _code_, which identifies the general BAPS command itself;
      # * A _sub-code_, which identifies variants of BAPS commands.
      #
      # The CommandWord class contains a method, #split, for splitting the word
      # into these two codes.

        # BAPS uses various bit-masks of its command word for various purposes.
        # The high bits generally encode the command type, while the low bits
        # encode the target channel, sub-commands, and other things.
        #
        # For our purposes, the subcode is the last four bits of the command
        # word.  This means that some subcommands in BAPS are full commands in
        # the bra BAPS driver, but most of the commands where this happens
        # aren't supported by us anyway.
