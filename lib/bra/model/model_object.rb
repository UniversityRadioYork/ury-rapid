    # An object in the bra playout system model.
    #
    # ModelObjects are composable entities, each assigned an ID by its parent,
    # that form a model tree traversable by relative URLs.
    #
    # Each ModelObject implements an interface based on the HTTP verbs GET,
    # PUT, POST and DELETE, both directly and via URL (for accessing objects
    # further down in the tree from the target).
    #
    # With the exception of GET, each verb is further subdivided into a form
    # that can trigger driver handlers to translate model change requests into
    # playout server actions, and a 'driver' form that bypasses these handlers.
