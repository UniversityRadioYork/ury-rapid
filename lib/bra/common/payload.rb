    # Payloads come in multiple formats:
    # - A URL payload, which specifies where the resource desired can be
    #   found in terms of a string locator;
    # - A hash payload, which directly specifies the properties the new
    #   resource will have according to some payload 'type';
    # - A hash mapping an ID to one of the above, thus directly specifying
    #   where in the model structure the new resource should go.
    #
    # This object takes a raw payload from the server, alongside the privileges
    # granted to the client sending it is; decides which form of payload it is;
    # then spits out a normalised form of the payload so that the handling
    # objects can interpret it.
