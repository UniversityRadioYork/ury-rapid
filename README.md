bra
===

__bra__ (BAPS Ruby Abstraction) is a project for creating a system to translate the binary protocol calls of URY's internal Broadcast and Presenting Suite (BAPS) to and from a more sensible and accessible medium.

This is in very early development.  Expect it not to do a lot.

Requirements
------------

* Ruby 2.0+
* A BAPS server (sadly not found outside of URY, really)

Usage
-----

For now, `ruby main.rb HOSTNAME PORT USERNAME PASSWORD` will invoke the testbed, which doesn't do much.
